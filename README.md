# Earthquake Recording Mapping
In this project I wanted to create a tool that could visualize earthquakes of a certain magnitude around the world.  The information used for this is from the USGS website and their records of significant earthquakes over the past 30 days.  Magnitude is show a color scale and by radius of the circles on the visuzalization.
