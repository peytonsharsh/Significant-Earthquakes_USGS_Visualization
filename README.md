# Earthquake Mapping
This project you will find the following files:
 - "index.html" - this contains the code for the creation of the web page.
 
 In the static folder you will find,
 - "config.js" - this is where an api key for Mapbox (https://www.mapbox.com/) is used to create the map base.
 - "logic.js" - this is the code where the map and earthquake data are combined and overlapped on the webpage creating the visual.
 - "style.css" - is the tweaking of the page to make the map and legend appear correctly.
